## Summary

Throughout this guide, we have provided detailed instructions on how to install `gluestack-style` in your Expo or Next.js application and configure its settings to ensure optimal performance. We highly recommend taking the time to familiarize yourself with the various aspects of gluestack-style, such as its configuration options and styled provider functionality, as well as the styled function.

To get started, we suggest reviewing the [config](gluestack.io/style/docs/configuration/theme-tokens) and [provider](gluestack.io/style/docs/getting-started/styled-provider) sections to gain a deeper understanding of aliases and tokens works. Once you have a solid grasp of these concepts, you can begin experimenting with the [styled](gluestack.io/style/docs/getting-started/styled) function and applying it to your project as needed.
